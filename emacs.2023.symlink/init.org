* Early setup
** Keymaps

I use a custom keymap for leader bindings, which we create early as lots of
code depends on it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-prefix-command 'md/leader-map)
#+END_SRC

** Dotfiles

I'm using org-mode to structure my configuration. Originally inspired by [[https://github.com/sachac/.emacs.d][Sacha
Chua]] and [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit/][Emacs Starter Kit]]. I want to be able to easily edit and compile this
file.

The rest of the file makes heavy use of use-package's features for setting
variables and key bindings, but it hasn't been loaded yet and I want it to be
easy to edit this file, so we use bind-key manually:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun md/maybe-native-compile-and-load (path loadp)
  "If a file exists and Emacs has the native compilation feature enabled,
use it to compile the file"
  (if (and path (file-exists-p path))
      (progn
        (when loadp
          (load-file path))
        (when (fboundp 'native-compile-async)
          (native-compile-async path t)))
    (message "Cannot load-file, doesn't exist: %s" path)))

(defun md/dotfiles-edit-init ()
  "Jump to my my init.org"
  (interactive)
  (find-file (md/emacs-get-path "init.org")))

(require 'bind-key)
(bind-key "ve" 'md/dotfiles-edit-init md/leader-map)
(bind-key "vc" 'md/dotfiles-compile-all md/leader-map)  ;; Defined in early-init file
#+END_SRC

** Xrandr

On Linux I use exwm to manage X windows/applications. These helpers let me
easily change monitor configurations. I define them early as I want to easily be
able to configure monitors, even if something breaks later in the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun md/exwm-display-one ()
  "If monitor is connected, only use that. Otherwise, only use the main display."
  (interactive)
  (let ((xrandr-output-regexp "\n\\([^ ]+\\) connected ")
        default-output)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (call-process "xrandr" nil t nil)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward xrandr-output-regexp nil 'noerror)
      (setq default-output (match-string 1))
      (forward-line)
      (if (not (re-search-forward xrandr-output-regexp nil 'noerror))
          (call-process "xrandr" nil nil nil "--output" default-output "--auto")
        (call-process
         "xrandr" nil nil nil
         "--output" (match-string 1) "--mode"
         (completing-read "Resolution: " '("2048x1080" "1920x1080" "2560x1440"))
         "--primary"
         "--output" default-output "--off")
        (setq exwm-randr-workspace-output-plist (list 0 (match-string 1)))))))

(defun md/exwm-display-mirror ()
  "Mirror display"
  (interactive)
  (let ((xrandr-output-regexp "\n\\([^ ]+\\) connected ")
        default-output)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (call-process "xrandr" nil t nil)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward xrandr-output-regexp nil 'noerror)
      (setq default-output (match-string 1))
      (forward-line)
      (if (not (re-search-forward xrandr-output-regexp nil 'noerror))
          (call-process "xrandr" nil nil nil "--output" default-output "--auto")
        (call-process
         "xrandr" nil nil nil
         "--output" default-output "--auto" "--primary"
         "--output" (match-string 1) "--auto" "--same-as" default-output)
        (setq exwm-randr-workspace-output-plist (list 0 default-output))))))

** Compat fix

[2023-11-19] I'm not sure what's happening exactly but compat-string-width is
expected to exist by consult, but doesn't. Defining it here early as a workaround.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

:PROPERTIES:
:LAST_REVIEWED: [2023-06-02 Fri]
:END:

I'm using straight to easily install packages and manage package
versions. They're automatically installed on startup as we default to setting
~:straight t~ in use-package.

The default installation instructions recommend eval'ing code from Github - I've
commented out that part below but that's one way I could re-install straight in
the future if I needed to and was happy with the Github content etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar straight-bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (straight-bootstrap-version 6))
  ;; (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
  ;;   (with-current-buffer
  ;;       (url-retrieve-synchronously
  ;;        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
  ;;        'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
  ;;     (goto-char (point-max))
  ;;     (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

;; Equivalent of using :straight t with use-package
(setq straight-use-package-by-default t)
#+END_SRC

Install use-package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

Configure use-package. We add a custom keyword ~:md/bind~ here. This is my
alternative to the included ~:bind~ keyword. It has fewer features overall
compared to ~:bind~, but offers two additional features that I miss - see the
docstring below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package use-package
  :custom
  (use-package-verbose t)
  (use-package-minimum-reported-time 0.001)

  :config
  (add-to-list 'use-package-keywords :md/bind t)

  (defun use-package-normalize/:md/bind (name keyword args)
    "Custom use-keyword :md/bind. I use this to provide something similar to ':bind',
but with additional two features that I miss from the default implementation:

1. Integration with 'evil-define-key', so I can extend the keymap declaration
   to specify one or more evil states that the binding should apply to.

2. The ability to detect keymaps that aren't defined as prefix commands. This
   allows me to define a binding to a keymap variable, eg. maybe I want '<leader>h'
   to trigger 'help-map'. This fails using the default ':bind', meaning that I
   have to fall back to calling 'bind-key' manually if I want to assign a
   prefix.

The expected form is slightly different to 'bind':

((:map (KEYMAP . STATE) (KEY . FUNC) (KEY . FUNC) ...)
 (:map (KEYMAP . STATE) (KEY . FUNC) (KEY . FUNC) ...) ...)

STATE is the evil state. It can be nil or omitted entirely. If given, it should be an
argument suitable for passing to 'evil-define-key' -- meaning a symbol like 'normal', or
a list like '(normal insert)'."

Undo-tree provides undo/redo branching. You can navigate your undo history using

[2023-08-23]: By default, if an org list item is checked using the square-bracket
syntax [X], then org will look for a parent checkbox, and if all child items are
checked, it will set [X] on the parent too. This isn't how I personally use
child items -- I'll often use child checkboxes as subtasks, but it's almost
never an exhaustive list of everything that has to be done to close out the
parent -- and so I'd prefer to just control the parent checkbox state manually, or ideally to opt-in to this
behaviour by using a syntax similar to [/], which is used to show the count
of completed children.

AFAICT org-mode doesn't provide a way to customise this behaviour, /but/ the
behaviour all seems to be implemented in 'org-list-struct-fix-box'. And so I'm
trying something out by turning it into a no-op. It seems to work nicely initially,
but I won't be surprised if it causes an issue at some point because it's very
hacky."

When calling org-agenda, before the '*Agenda Commands*' buffer is switched to,
there's a manual call to (delete-other-windows). These windows are restored once
you've selected an agenda command, but I find it jarring to have my windows
temporarily disappear, and as the '*Agenda Commands*' buffer is quite small, it
isn't necessary to delete everything else on my screen. Org-capture has a
similar issue.

Unfortunately there's no clean way to prevent this behaviour. Eg. for org-agenda
it happens inside (org-agenda-get-restriction-and-command) with an inlined call
to (delete-other-windows). This is a quite a long function, and isn't something
that I want to inline and redefine myself. So instead we have this hacky
dual-advice approach: this advice will create temporary advice to turn
delete-other-windows into a no-op, and then restore once the org function has exited."

** ox-rss

[2021-06-16] Ox-rss allows for publishing of a feed.xml RSS file. This is
useful, but has a big performance issue: it hangs for 30s+ running
~(indent-region)~ as part of prettifying the XML file.

To get around this, we redefine ~org-rss-final-function~ and skip the indenting
part. The resulting file still has appropriate newlines everywhere, they're just
not indented with leading whitespace, which is fine.

* [[https://github.com/Fanael/edit-indirect/blob/master/edit-indirect.el][Edit-indirect]]

[2023-06-03] This provides a function to edit a selected region in an indirect
buffer. I don't use it that often but I can use it to do things like opening up
inline sql strings in sql mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package edit-indirect)
#+end_src

I'm not sure why I didn't use built-in indirect edit features for this, maybe
something to do with this section of the docs:

#+begin_quote
This differs from `clone-indirect-buffer' with narrowing in that
the text properties are not shared, so the parent buffer major mode
and the edit-indirect buffer major mode will not be able to tread
on each other's toes by setting up potentially conflicting text
properties, which happens surprisingly often when the font-lock
mode is used.

* [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] and friends

[2023-06-03] I'm trying these out as a replacement for Helm. My understanding of
the division between these packages is:

- Vertico :: Vertical completion UI.

- Orderless :: Provides the "completion style", ie. how the string matching
  works.

- Marginalia :: Provides text annotations in the minibuffer, eg. for
  ~describe-variable~ this shows the value of the variable and the first
  characters of its docstring. This also shows various buffer info like the
  visited filename and major mode.

- Consult :: Provides various features that make use of ~completing-read~, eg. a
  buffer-selection command similar to ~helm-mini~, search interfaces, jumping to
  files, Emacs theme selection etc.

Put together you get something more modular than Helm, which is the main tool
I've used previously for this kind of fzf selection feature.

#+END_SRC

Note on Tramp from the docs:

#+begin_quote
The basic completion style is specified as fallback in addition to orderless in
order to ensure that completion commands which rely on dynamic completion
tables, e.g., completion-table-dynamic or completion-table-in-turn, work
correctly. Furthermore the basic completion style needs to be tried first (not
as a fallback) for TRAMP hostname completion to work. In order to achieve that,
we add an entry for the file completion category in the
completion-category-overrides variable. In addition, the partial-completion
style allows you to use wildcards for file completion and partial paths, e.g.,
/u/s/l for /usr/share/local.

~git-gutter~ shows a +/-/~ symbol in a gutter on the left of the buffer. I got
used to this back when I was using vim and found it very helpful.

[2024-10-13] Adding ~md/git-file-history~, which allows me to look through past
versions of the current file and open them at a particular revision, using
git-gutter to show which lines in that commit were added/removed/changed. There
are other features like this, eg ~vc-revision-other-window~, but I couldn't find
anything that both (1) lets me consult to select/preview the file, and (2) shows
diff indicators.

Also adding ~md/git-gutter-auto-diff-mode~, to use the ~git-gutter:popup-hunk~
feature to automatically show the diff buffer when you're on a hunk.

[2024-02-28] Useful package providing a consult interface for the
~workspace/symbols~ lsp call. This just provides one command --
~consult-eglot-symbols~. It's similar to xref-find-apropros but lets you
view/group/filter the type of symbol, so you can more easily see eg.
just function definitions and ignore variables.

    "If eglot is enabled and managing xref, consult-eglot-symbols is
similar to xref-find-apropos, because they both call :workspace/symbol on the
language server. The main difference is that consult-eglot-symbols groups and
lets you filter by symbol type, which can be useful if there are lots of
matches. Xref-find-apropos groups by file and doesn't show the type of the
symbol. I don't want to have to think about using both functions, so if
consult-eglot-symbols works, we'll use that, otherwise we fall back to
xref-find-apropos.

This should catch cases both where eglot isn't running for a buffer, and also
where the language server doesn't support the workspace/symbol call, in which
case if another xref backend is available that will be used instead.

If the eglot xref backend gets updated to provide more symbol-type-aware
features, then I can get rid of this and just use xref."

#+end_src

Looking at ~*gptel-log*~, here's how the API content works:

- The org chat minor-mode buffer sends everything as context, unless you start a
  new org topic using ~GPTEL_TOPIC~. It uses overlays to identify previous
  requests/responses in the buffer, and these get sent as history for each
  request.

- The ~gptel-send~ feature works similarly. It does not share history with
  other org chat sessions, but uses overlays to identify messages so you can
  build up a similar chat experience.

- If you edit the buffer contents that includes the request/response messages,
  then on next message the history sent will be your edited version.

- By default, added gptel context gets put into the system "content" value. This
  is included both for ~gptel-send~, and the minor-mode chat buffers. This
  context also appears in requests made manually with ~(gptel-request)~: even if
  you specify ~:context~ in the call, your global gptel context will be appended
  to it.

Some functions for interacting with aider in a comint buffer. For coding
projects this is more useful than gptel, as it provides proper file edits and
knows more about the codebase structure through the repo map and treesitter etc.

* Server

Always run the server so I can use emacsclient as my terminal editor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package server
  :config (when (not (server-running-p))
            (server-start)))
#+end_src

* Local

For any machine-specific setup code, I load ~/.local.el~. This is also where I
hook into some code that's not in this file, eg. my list of RSS feeds.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacs
  :init
  (defconst md/dotfiles-init-local-path "~/.local.el")
